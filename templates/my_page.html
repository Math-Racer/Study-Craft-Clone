<h1>Learning Objectives to make sure your learning is efficient throughout</h1>
<p>Given the 30-day study plan for an exam in Data Science, the aim is to structure the learning objectives around core topics within the field, such as statistics, programming (with a focus on Python and R), data handling and processing, machine learning, and data visualization. The use of active recall questions encourages the student to engage deeply with the material, strengthening memory retention and understanding. </p>
<h3>Day 1-5: Statistics for Data Science</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 1:</strong> What is the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics?</li>
<li><strong>Day 2:</strong> How does a normal distribution function, and why is it important in data science?</li>
<li><strong>Day 3:</strong> What are the types of biases in sampling, and how can they be avoided?</li>
<li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Explain the concept of p-values and their significance in hypothesis testing.</li>
<li><strong>Day 5:</strong> How do you interpret a confidence interval, and what does it tell you about the data?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Day 6-10: Programming (Python and R)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 6:</strong> Write a Python function to calculate the mean and median from a list of numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Day 7:</strong> How do you handle missing values in a dataset using R?</li>
<li><strong>Day 8:</strong> Demonstrate how to use a for-loop in Python to iterate over a list.</li>
<li><strong>Day 9:</strong> In R, how do you apply a function over elements in a vector or list?</li>
<li><strong>Day 10:</strong> Explain the difference between a DataFrame in Python's pandas library and a data frame in R.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Day 11-15: Data Handling and Processing</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 11:</strong> What are the steps to clean a dataset, and why is each step important?</li>
<li><strong>Day 12:</strong> How would you join two datasets together using Python's pandas library?</li>
<li><strong>Day 13:</strong> Demonstrate how to normalize and standardize data, explaining why each is necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Day 14:</strong> What is the purpose of data partitioning in the context of model training and testing?</li>
<li><strong>Day 15:</strong> Describe how to handle categorical data in machine learning preprocessing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Day 16-20: Machine Learning</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 16:</strong> What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?</li>
<li><strong>Day 17:</strong> Explain the concept of overfitting and underfitting, and how can you prevent them?</li>
<li><strong>Day 18:</strong> What are the main types of algorithms used in clustering, and how do they differ?</li>
<li><strong>Day 19:</strong> Describe how a decision tree is constructed and used for prediction.</li>
<li><strong>Day 20:</strong> Explain the use of cross-validation in evaluating the performance of a machine learning model.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Day 21-25: Data Visualization</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 21:</strong> What are the considerations when choosing a type of plot or chart to represent data?</li>
<li><strong>Day 22:</strong> How do you create a histogram in Python using matplotlib, and what does it show?</li>
<li><strong>Day 23:</strong> Demonstrate how to use ggplot2 in R for creating a scatter plot.</li>
<li><strong>Day 24:</strong> Explain the importance of color, scale, and layout in data visualization.</li>
<li><strong>Day 25:</strong> How can interactive visualizations enhance the presentation of data insights?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Day 26-30: Review and Advanced Topics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Day 26:</strong> Summarize how Big Data technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark) interact with data science.</li>
<li><strong>Day 27:</strong> What are the ethical considerations in data science practice?</li>
<li><strong>Day 28:</strong> How does deep learning differ from traditional machine learning algorithms?</li>
<li><strong>Day 29:</strong> Discuss the role of neural networks in data science, particularly in processing unstructured data.</li>
<li><strong>Day 30:</strong> Review any topics you found challenging, and outline how data science can be applied to solve real-world problems.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Each day, the student should actively try to recall answers to these questions without looking at their notes initially. This practice encourages deeper engagement with the material. For concepts or questions that are particularly challenging, supplemental materials such as online courses, textbooks, and peer discussions should be encouraged.</p>
